Changes
=======

asq 1.0.1
---------

Fixed the repr() operator on Queryable so that it never consumes the underlying
iterable; doing so caused major problems with debuggers which used repr() for
displaying program state.  The repr() operator now correctly shows the class
type.

The implementation of OrderedQueryable.__iter__ has been refactored and
simplified a little to improve maintainability.

The implementation of the Lookup.__init__ method has been refactored and
simplified a little to improve maintainability.

asq 1.0
-------

Huge correctness and completeness changes for 1.0 since 0.9.  The API now has
feature equivalence with LINQ for objects with 100% test coverage and complete
documentation.

The API has been very much reorganised with some renaming of crucial functions.
The important asq() function is now called query() to prevent a clash with the
package name itself and is found in the asq.initiators package.

For common asq usage you now need to do::

  from asq.initiators import query
  a = [1, 2, 3]
  query(a).select(lambda x: x*x).to_list()
  
to get started.  For more than that, consult the documentation.
