Changes
=======

asq 1.3
-------

There are several minor breaking API changes in this release. Please read
carefully more details:

  * Re-assigns copyright from Robert Smallshire to Sixty North AS.

  * Adds ``select_with_correspondence()`` query method.

  * Renames the ``indexedelement`` module to ``namedelements``.

  * Renames the second element of ``IndexedElement`` from ``element`` to
    ``value``.

  * Adds the ``KeyedElement`` ``namedtuple`` to the ``namedelements`` module.
    ``KeyedElement`` has two elements called ``key`` and ``value``.

  * Queryable.to_dictionary() no longer raises an exception if the key_selector
    produces duplicate keys. Instead, the values associated with later keys
    overwrite those produced by earlier keys.  This weakening of the
    to_dictionary() constract allows us to maintain Liskov subsstitutability in
    light of the specialised default key and value selectors for the overrides
    of ``to_dictionary()`` provided for the ``Lookup`` and ``Grouping`` classes.
    (See the next two changes for more details).

  * Less surprising behaviour for ``Lookup.to_dictionary()``:
    The default key and value selectors for ``Lookup.to_dictionary()`` are
    overidden, so that the produced dictionary contains a single item for each
    ``Grouping`` such that the key of each item is the key of the corresponding
    ``Grouping`` and the value of the item is a list of the elements from the
    ``Grouping``.

  * Less surprising behaviour for ``Grouping.to_dictionary()``:
    The default key and value selectors for ``Grouping.to_dictionary()`` are
    overidden, so that the produced dictionary contains a single item, such that
    the key of the item is the key of the ``Grouping`` and the value of the item
    is a ``list`` containing the elements from the ``Grouping``.

asq 1.2.1
---------

  * Fixes a problem in setup.py that prevented installation on Python 2.

asq 1.2
-------

  * The default selector for select_with_index() now produces a new IndexedElement
    object for each type which is a namedtuple.  As IndexedElement is a tuple this
    change is backwards compatibile, but now the more readable item.index and
    item.element attributes can be used instead of accessing via indexes zero and
    one.

asq 1.1
-------

  * The selector factories k_(), a_() and m_() have much faster implementations
    because they are now simply aliases for itemgetter, attrgetter and
    methodcaller from the Python standard library operator module.  As a
    result, even though they remain backwards API compatible with those in
    asq 1.0 their capabilities are also extended somewhat:

      * k_ can optionally accept more than one argument (key) and if so, the
        selector it produces will return a tuple of multiple looked-up values
        rather than a single value.

      * a_ can optionally accept more than one argument (key) and if so, the
        selector it produces will return a tuple of multiple looked-up values
        rather than a single value. Furthermore, the attribute names supplied
        in each argument can now contain dots to refer to nested attributes.

  * Added asq.selectors.make_selector which will create a selector directly
    from a string or integer using attribute or item lookup respectively.

asq 1.0
-------

Huge correctness and completeness changes for 1.0 since 0.9.  The API now has
feature equivalence with LINQ for objects with 100% test coverage and complete
documentation.

The API has been very much reorganised with some renaming of crucial functions.
The important asq() function is now called query() to prevent a clash with the
package name itself and is found in the asq.initiators package.

For common asq usage you now need to do::

  from asq.initiators import query
  a = [1, 2, 3]
  query(a).select(lambda x: x*x).to_list()
  
to get started.  For more than that, consult the documentation.
